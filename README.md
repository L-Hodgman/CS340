SNHU CS-340: Client/Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write a program that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable, its important to keep the code as simple as possible, have good commenting, and develope code that can be easily adapted into other projects. When the code is too complicated, it impacts the maintainability and readablity of the code. My CRUD python module can now be utilized for any other future projects that involve MongoDB databases.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientists, I start by brain storming how to build the client's requirements. I try to factor in what will be needed and how everything will piece together. The biggest difference between this project was working with new systems and languages. This is the first time I have worked with HTML, MongoDB, PyMongo. It turned out to be a very informative course, which I know will be used in future courses. Doing a lot of research through the resources was crutial in building this project. I think as a computer scientist, I will forever have to do research when building a new system.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scentists create, improve, test, and deploy software applications. With technology and the internet essentially running the world, computer scientists play a crutial role in today's society. This project can help company's, like Grazioso Salvare, build their company faster and potentially help save more lives. Without this system, Grazioso Salvare could miss out on a lot of great candidates for their training program. With this system, they can remotely and easily check for candidates every day.
